The giant anaconda is a mythical snake of enormous proportions said to be found in South America.
Anaconda is an unincorporated community in Franklin County, Missouri, in the United States.
In 1903, the Socialist Party of America won its first victory west of the Mississippi when Anaconda voters elected a socialist mayor, treasurer, police judge, and three councilmen.
Anaconda was founded by Marcus Daly, one of the Copper Kings, who financed the construction of a smelter on nearby Warm Springs Creek to process copper ore from the Butte mines.
